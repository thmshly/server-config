# TODO:
# 	Branches
# 		- Tidy master to be presentable:
#!#			. Remove todos- this is not feasible
#!# 		. Comment and group unimplemented features
# 	- fix bundling so that string options cannot start with a - or --
# 	- allow a default list separator, e.g. item1,item2,item3 here a comma, so that both a comma or a space can be used to form lists
# 	- nginx config functions - Probably not going to happen here.
# 	- git config functions: set name and email? 
#	- etckeeper init
#!#	- add and parse repos to automatically add to apt sources
# 	- allow escaping 'updates' in --install and $defaultPkgs. Maybe there's a package called updates?? Or prepend keyword with special charater.
# 	- add more comments
# 	- use POD for documentation
# 	- create --help output
# 	- create wrapper for system() to allow simultaneous printing of debug text and running commands. and also automate sudo use if not running as root.
# 	- case sensitive short options, more possibilities.
# 	- make $supplement actually work: --install needs a value, and it can take '-', which is undesirable. See first todo. Use die("!FINISH") in anon sub 
# 	  after checking for "-"?
# 	- implement --prompt: prompts user before continuing for each 'action'. Or even better: --no-prompt Hardwire this into system() wrapper!
#!#	- convert all regex to /( |^)$keyword( |$)/
# 	- strip 'updates' and 'defaults' keywords from packages lists in &apt() at all points of install
# 	- fix BUG: &parseDefaults() '+ <item>' syntax to append to defaults will not work with comma separated lists, as in $defaultGroups. Hence, global 
#	  separator value THAT IS USED. It's a matter of style I guess..? For useradd commas are more convenient, but not for apt-get, par example..
#?  - make_free uninstalls packages identified by vrms: e.g. java

# DOING:
#!#	- Apt sources DONE. Ok,now really done.
# 	- ssh config: change port number, timeout options?
#!# - FIXED>Refactored as anonymous subroutine. !now uses eval in &users(). FIX BUG: $defaultDir isn't set in decl, nor in &users()..
#   - Implementing &sys()
#	- Fix regex line 233: merging defaults keyword with other user requested packages. The string must contain more than ' defaults' or 'defaults '
# 	- Change var $kySrvString to $kySrvIdentStrg
#!#	- BUG!Fixed: add-apt-repository --remove contrib|non-free doesn't work. Used a perl one liner regex to remove $unfree from sources.list.
#!#	- DONE: --repos make_free regex required in $unfree for perl 1 liner. However, order of repos (contrib non-free) must match sources.list.. remove each separately?
#!  - BUG: first download of dotfiles with --conf -o root moves any originals to ".dotfile.orig".epoch(); However, if this is executed a second time
#	  the dotfiles are saved as ".dotfile.1", etc.  Is this  problem with epoch(), or something else? Only execed the 2nd after logging out.
