This is a work in progress. An attempt to refresh my perl while creating something that might be of use.

**The current progress has not been tested (only echoed to terminal).**

When it has been tested on a server I will rewrite this README with full usage instructions.

If at all important, the license is [MIT-LICENSE](MIT-LICENSE.txt).
